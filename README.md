# Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_RNN

### Project Overview
In this project, I worked with the IMDb dataset, which contains movie reviews along with their corresponding labels (positive or negative). The goal is to build a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model that can classify the sentiment of these reviews. Here are the main steps involved:

**Data Preparation:** Loaded and explored the IMDb dataset.

**Feature Engineering:** Preprocessed the text data to make it suitable for training.

**Model Building:** Constructed a simple RNN model using Keras.

**Model Training:** Trained the RNN model on the processed data.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance on a test set.

**Model Deployment:** Deployed the model using a Streamlit web app.

**Cloud Deployment:** Deployed the Streamlit app to the cloud for wider accessibility.

**Project Architecture**
Let's outline the architecture of the project:

**Input Data:** The IMDb movie reviews dataset.

**Feature Engineering:** Converted text data into numerical format using tokenization and padding.

**Simple RNN Model:** Built an RNN model with an embedding layer.

**Training:** Trained the model on the processed data.
**Deployment:** Created a Streamlit web app to interact with the trained model
